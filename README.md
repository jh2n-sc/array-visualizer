# Array Visualizer

I made a small code that you can use for visualizing how the computer
or your algorithm sorts an array. 

I used selection-bubble sort(unoptimized) for sorting an array. But you can
implement your own algorithm.

No external dependencies required. Just a working JDK and you are good to go.

To start: click ```'c'``` in your keyboard.
To shuffle: click ```'space'```.
